FUTURE_ML_01

This repository contains the Colab notebook FUTURE_ML_01.ipynb, which demonstrates machine learning workflows and experiments for future-focused ML projects.

-> Project Overview

- Built and tested in Google Colab.
- Contains end-to-end ML pipeline steps including:
- Data loading & preprocessing
- Model training & evaluation
- Visualization of results

-> How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/kruthi-0101/FUTURE_ML_01.git
cd FUTURE_ML_01

Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab:

Google Colab: Upload FUTURE_ML_01.ipynb to Colab and run.
Local Jupyter: Run:
jupyter notebook FUTURE_ML_01.ipynb

-> Files

FUTURE_ML_01.ipynb â†’ Main notebook with ML workflow.

-> Requirements

Python 3.x
Common ML/data libraries (may vary depending on the notebook): numpy, pandas, matplotlib / seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow / pytorch (if used)

Install dependencies with: pip install -r requirements.txt

(You can generate requirements.txt later using pip freeze > requirements.txt in Colab if needed.)

-> Future Work

- Expand dataset experiments
- Test additional ML/DL models
- Deploy trained models for real-world usage
